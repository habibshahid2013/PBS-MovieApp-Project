## About The Project

Build a web application that allows users to search and view information about movies using the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.

Technical Requirements:

Use React or Next.js for the frontend and CSS or SASS for styling.
Use a free hosting service such as Heroku or Zeit for hosting the application.
Provide a git repository with your code.

## Built With

This application is built with the following technologies:


* [Next.JS]()
* [Graphql]()
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The first thing you want to do is ensure after cloning the application you want to run the following command. 

* npm

```
npm install
```

### Installation

 1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/habibshahid2013/PBS-MovieApp-Project.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Then run the Next.js build command. 

```sh
npm run build
```

4. Then run the Next.js start command and you will find the application in localhost:3000

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Usage

You should see within the local host the application renders with a search bar. You should be able to type in any movie and it should appear on the screen. Also, other movies fit that description. You should also be able to click on the movie and a pop-up should appear on the screen so that you can see details about the movie.

---------------------------------------------------------




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## About The Project

Build a web application that allows users to search and view information about movies using the The Movie Database (tmdb) API.

Technical Requirements:

Use React or Next.js for the frontend and CSS or SASS for styling.
Use a free hosting service such as Vercel or AWS Amplify for hosting the application.
Provide a git repository with your code.

## Built With

This application is built with the following technologies:


* [Next.JS]()
* [Graphql]()
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

The first thing you want to do is ensure after cloning the application you want to run the following command. 

* npm

```
npm install
```

### Installation

 1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/habibshahid2013/PBS-MovieApp-Project.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Then run the Next.js build command. 

```sh
npm run build
```

4. Then run the Next.js start command and you will find the application in localhost:3000

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Usage

You should see within the local host the application renders with a search bar. You should be able to type in any movie and it should appear on the screen. Also, other movies fit that description. You should also be able to click on the movie and a pop-up should appear on the screen so that you can see details about the movie.
